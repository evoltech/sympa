historical stuff, might be useful again
---------------------------------------
aol/ - some old stuff for cleaning up aol bounces
backup - old backup script, unknown state
common - file sourced by other scripts to get the db info so it doesn't need
   to be embedded in each script. we're moving all script to just assume that
   the running user has a my.cnf setup. this will go away once it's not used
   by other scripts

unknown, needs to be reviewed
-----------------------------

   be nice to have a tool that checks
