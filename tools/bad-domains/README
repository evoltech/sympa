Bad Domains
-----------
These scripts are for dealing with the fact that sympa's bounce management
processing isn't good at removing bad addresses that only receive a low
volume of mail.

sympa-bad-domains - get a list of email addresses from sympa and determine
  which domains don't currently resolve. Intended to be run by cron once
  a month.

sympa-persistent-bad-domains - using the last 3 results of sympa-bad-domains
  list all domains that are persistently bad.

find-bad-addresses - using the list of persistent bad domains from
  sympa-persistent-bad-domains, find all the addresses for those domains
  and return a list of addresses and a list of address count by domain.
