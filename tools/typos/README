sympa typo checking scripts
---------------------------
lists/ - contains files listing common typos domains

findtypes - returns the list of addresses in the db that match one of the
   typo domains and some stats about which lists have a lot of typos and
   might be violating our ToS by doing bulk adds of non opt-in addresses.

mktransport - generates a postfix map for all the typos
