sympa typo checking scripts
---------------------------
lists/ - contains files listing common typos domains

typoaddresses - returns the list of addresses in the db that match one
                 of the typo domains. These addresses can be cleaned up

typolists - returns a list of the top 25 lists by number of typo addresses.
             Lists with a lot of typos might be violating our ToS by doing
             bulk adds of non opt-in addresses.
