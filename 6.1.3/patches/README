02_list_db_caching
-------------------
This patch creates a mysql table called list_table which caches some list config information.  
This table is then used by wwsympa to get lists of lists so that wwsympa doesn't have to 
traverse the lists data directory to get lists is lists.

If this patch is installed to a new instance of sympa without any existing lists, no further 
acount is necessary.

If this patch is installed to an existing instance of sympa, you will need to load all 
existing lists into the new table. To do so, run:
sympa.pl --sync_db_list
