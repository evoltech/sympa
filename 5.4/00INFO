Each of these patches has been adapted to work with the version of sympa the directory
is named after. They are in a particular chronological order as many patches change
files that later patches also change. As such, they must be applied in the order
that they are named.

To apply:

patch --dry-run -p0 < 01_add_Sender_header.diff

while in the sympa source directory. Once you are satisfied that it applies
cleanly, you can remove the --dry-run.
