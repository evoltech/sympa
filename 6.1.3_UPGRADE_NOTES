* Add Sender patch is no longer needed!  List.pm now does this:
    $hdr->add('Sender', "$self->{'name'}-request\@$self->{'admin'}{'host'}"); # The Sender: header should be add at least for DKIM compatibility

* skipping patch to remove IP address - this needs to be taken care of in the apache config instead
