Instructions to upgrade sympa for riseup:

1. Download and untar new source

2. convert official patches from last version to work with new version

   These are the current patches we use, and how to test they are working (where necessary):

   a. list config caching path
     To test:
     * creating a new list request should populate list_table with the pending list
     * approving the new list should change its status in the db
     * listing pending and closed lists should work and should only be listing lists that are in the list_table cache
     * renaming a list should rename it in the db

   b. add Sender: header

   c. do not change renames to pending status

   d. remove IP addresses

   *** patches a-d are more 'core' patches 
   *** patches e-g are more specific to riseup

   e. fix owner privileges - we give list owners more privileges than the default install

   f. do not allow list creation by copying an existing list 
      this is disabled in the templates, mainly, but this disables it in the function too in case it gets past the template

   g. do not save invalid paths referring to arcsearch_id - this makes wwsympa unhappy 

3. run configure: 
./configure \
--prefix=/home/sympa \
--with-confdir=/etc/sympa \
--with-initdir=/etc/init.d/ \
--enable-secure

4. stop sympa

5. compile and install sympa following sympa upgrade instructions

6. look at sympa.pl --upgrade and see if there's anything we can skip
6a. run sympa.pl --upgrade

7. check create list templates
   the following list types only should be available on the create lists page:
     1-moderated-discussion-list
     2-open-discussion-list
     3-private-working-group
     4-public-working-group
     5-newsletter

   to accomplish this, make sure that any directory called 'create_list_templates' in /home/sympa only contains
   the above templates.

7. check scenari files
   scenari files describe permissions for subscribing and unsubscribing,
   among other things. we have some scenaris disabled (for example, the
   scenari that closes unsubscribing).
   The scenari files are deployed by the site-sympa puppet module, follow
   the instructions there to update them for a new release.

6. start sympa
