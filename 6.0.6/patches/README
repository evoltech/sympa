Patches
=======

All patches should be applied to a clean sympa source tree, before the make process.

01_list_db_caching
------------------
This patch creates a mysql table called list_table which caches some list config information.  
This table is then used by wwsympa to get lists of lists so that wwsympa doesn't have to 
traverse the lists data directory to get lists is lists.

If this patch is installed to a new instance of sympa without any existing lists, no further 
acount is necessary.

If this patch is installed to an existing instance of sympa, you will need to load all 
existing lists into the new table. To do so, run:
sympa.pl --sync_db_list

02_add_sender_header
--------------------
adds a Sender header to outgoing messages produced by the server, enables DKIM signatures to work

03_rename_lists_no_pending
--------------------------
prevents lists going in to 'pending' status if they are renamed.

04_remove_ip_address
---------------------
blanks out IP address in numerous places

05_fix_owner_privileges
-----------------------
levels out privilege difference between regular list owners and privliged list owners so that 
they essentially have the same privileges

06_disable_copy_list
--------------------
disables the ability to copy an existing list at the perl library level. this is also done on the 
template level (which is not included in this patch).

07_do_not_save_unauth_arcsearch_id
----------------------------------
if a bad request comes in for arcsearch_id, do not save this in the sessions table. also, route the 
request to show a proper unauthorized page.

08 disable active and latest lists
-----------------------------------
rss requests to active_lists and latest_lists crash wwsympa. disable for now (should make a real patch one day)
