Patches

01_rename_lists_no_pending

https://labs.riseup.net/code/issues/4066

02_disable_copy_list
--------------------
disables the ability to copy an existing list at the perl library level. this is also done on the 
template level (which is not included in this patch).
https://labs.riseup.net/code/projects/lists/activity?from=2012-10-05

03_disable_latest_and_active_lists
-----------------------------------
rss requests to active_lists and latest_lists crash wwsympa. disable for now (should make a real patch one day)

04_fix_search_list.patch
---------------------------
patches do_search_list so that it calls get_lists_db directly with SQL conditions to limit the number of lists that get_lists has to loop through.
TODO: need to file a bug for this.

05_disable_latest_and_active_lists.patch
-----------------------------------------
we still need to disable listing of latest and active lists, since these operations still time out.
TODO; need to file a bug for this and press the issue upstream

06_fix_pending_lists.patch
----------------------------
do_get_pending_lists in wwsympa.fcgi needs to be patched to pre-select all lists with status 'pending', and then it can pass those lists to get_lists.
